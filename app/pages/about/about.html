	We at Rashi E Waste trade out many discarded machines which contain usable parts which could be salvaged and combined with other used equipment to create a working unit.

	NGOs and manufacturers would need help in environmentally sound recycling of e-waste which requires sophisticated technology and processes, which are not only very expensive, but also need specific skills and training for the operation.

	<div class="item text-justify padding">
	We have about 30+ years of total experience in all of the IT processes and the respective controls that are required for such operations, including a massive learning and working experience from the Big Blue IBM.

	Currently we are in the process of developing guidelines for environmentally sound recycling of E Wastes and which is our final goal and vision.

	<div class="item text-justify padding">
	The best option for dealing with E wastes is to reduce the volume. We as designers are trying to ensure that the product is built for re-use, repair and/or upgradeability.

	Stress is being laid on use of less toxic, easily recoverable and recyclable materials which can be taken back for refurbishment, remanufacturing, disassembly and reuse. Recycling and reuse of material are the next level of potential options to reduce e-waste

	Hence in the beginning we have drawn a boundary for ourselves to start of with at least 2 or 3 steps of this entire lifecycle and to act as a Refurbisher and to put these things into proper use and also to build a better world.
